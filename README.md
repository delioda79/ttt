The ttt software is a service for playing Tic Tac Toe

The service is Stateful and works with only two players, no multiple games are available now and it stops at the end of a game.

The game itself is built as a struct with a Run method wich accepts incoming messages to a channel of bytes

There might be several ways to expose teh service and teh way it's been exposed here is witha simple websocket so that is possible for people to use it directly.

A service in a microservices or SOA architecture should by preference be non acessible directly builtin this case I've opted fora direct access as it is a game which need sto be tested.

In this case th elogic for the communication is in teh main, but it should more correctly put in a separate module
so that is possible to expose teh service in different ways.

In order to run the service it is enough to call:
```
go run main.go
```

or to call the executable when installed.

The service runs also a small webserver which exposes a simple page whereit is possible to open a socket connection
to the service and to send a message.

The first player openng a connection will be Cross, teh second will be Nought, no mor eusers will be available.

A message shoudl be in the form:

{"X": 0, "Y": 1}
